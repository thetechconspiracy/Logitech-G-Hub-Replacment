# Logitech-G-Hub-Replacment
Because G Hub is garbage

Desigined for a Logitech G502.  This may work for other mice, but it may require tweaking.
This is designed for my usage.  However, the AutoHotKey script is easy to modify if you desire different functions

Usage: 
0. Configure mouse lighting as desired in GHub
1. Install AutoHotKey
2. In Logitech GHub, map the buttons on the mouse as follows:

  *G5: F16
  *G6: F17
  *G7: F14
  *G8: F13
  *G9: F15
  *G Shift: F18
  
3. Set the mouse into On Board mode (In the configuration page in GHub for the mouse, enable On Board Mode)
4. Set the On Board Profile to your current GHub profile (Click Profile 1/whatever profile you desire the configuration on), and click "Replace with Desktop")
5. Make any desired modifications to the script
6. Compile the AutoHotKey script (Right click, Compile Script)
7. Run the script
8. Place the .exe file in your Startup folder (shell:startup)
9. Uninstall GHub with prejudice, and feel relieved that you don't have to touch it again
